# StarCraft_AI
An artificial intelligence agent for playing StarCraft Brood War.

This is a final team project for CSC-568 Artificial Intelligence.

## Project requirements:
Unlike Project 1, there are no individual roles. All team members are held equally responsible for all aspects of the project. 
The basic capabilities of your agents should include:
 - Resource gathering for both minerals and vespene gas.
 - Ability to place buildings for construction.
 - Execution of at least one build order.
 - Ability to construct worker and combat units.
 - Micromanagement of units.
 - Being able to build and use  tier 1 units for each faction:
    - Terran: SCVs, marines and medics.
    - Zerg: Drones, zerglings and hydralisks.
    - Protoss: Probes, zealots, and dragoons.
 - Being able to build and use some tier 2 units for each faction:
    - Terran: Siege tanks, goliaths, vultures, or wraiths.
    - Zerg: Lurkers or mutalisks.
    - Protoss: Templars, dark templars, reavers, observers, or corsairs.

All deliverables should be available on GitHub. Required deliverables include:
 - Code that is clean, documented, and has appropriate class decomposition.
 - High-level overview of your approach (ballpark of 500 words in the README in the base of your repository).
 - Technical summary of your agent including a system diagram, explanation of all major classes, and a time-based guide as to what the agent does over time (also in the README).
